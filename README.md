# DSA-Challenge
Data Structures and Algorithm Learning Challenge

## Day 01

Learn all these concepts:

* What is a data structure ?
* What are different types of data structures (primitive, non-primitive, linear, non-linear) ?
* What is algorithm ?
* What is complexity analysis ?
* What is Big O notation ?
* How is memory allocation done in memory ?
* How is a integer and character stored in memory ?
* What is bit and byte ?
* Difference between contiguous and non contiguous memory allocation ?

## Day 02

Learn all these concepts:

* What is the difference between static array and dynamic array ?
* How is the array stored in memory
* What is the complexity of operations get, set, insert, delete, initialize, declare, and search in an array ?
* What is a linked list ?
* Difference between a linked list and an array ?
* What is the complexity of operations get, set, insert, delete, initialize, declare, and search in a linked list ?
* Difference between singly linked list and doubly linked list.

## Day 03

Implement a singly linked list with the following functions:

* `insert_at_beginning()`
  - Arguments: `data`
  - Functionality: Add the given data to the beginning of the linked list
* `insert_at_end()`
  - Arguments: `data`
  - Functionality: add the given data to the end of the linked list
* `insert_after_value()`
  - Arguments: `element`, `data`
  - Functionality: add the given `data` after the `element`
* `insert_from_array()`
  - Arguments: `data(array)`
  - Functionality: add all the elements of `data` to end of the linked list one after other
* `delete_by_value()`
  - Arguments: `data`
  - Functionality: delete the first occurring `data`
* `if_value_exists()`
  - Arguments: `data`
  - Functionality: will return boolean true if data exists or else false
* `total_node_count()`
  - Functionality: will return int value of total elements in the linked list
* `display_nodes()`
  - Functionality: will print all element one by one

## Day 04

Implement a doubly linked list with the following functions:

* `insert_at_end()`
  - Arguments: `data`
  - Functionality: add the given data to the end of the linked list
* `delete_by_value()`
  - Arguments: `data`
  - Functionality: delete the first occurring `data`
* `if_value_exists()`
  - Arguments: `data`
  - Functionality: will return boolean true if data exists or else false
* `display_nodes()`
  - Functionality: will print all element one by one
* `display_nodes_in_reverse()`
  - Functionality: will print all element one by one in reverse order.
